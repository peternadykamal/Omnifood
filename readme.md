## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the website is built using HTML, ensuring semantic and accessible markup.

- **CSS:** The website is fully styled using CSS, demonstrating a keen understanding of design principles and aesthetics. The use of shades and tints of the primary color follows the upbeat and modern design style.

- **JavaScript:** Minimal JavaScript is employed to enhance user interactions and functionality where necessary.

## Responsive Design

The website embraces a "desktop-first" design approach, ensuring a seamless and visually pleasing experience on larger screens. To achieve responsiveness, media queries are strategically implemented at the following breakpoints:

- 1334px
- 1200px
- 940px
- 700px
- 500px

This approach allows the website to adapt gracefully to various screen sizes and devices, showcasing the ability to create a user-friendly experience across the spectrum of devices.
